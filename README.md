# MyFirst


Hello everyone!
My name is Angela Ma. Feel free to call me Angela.
I come from Harbin, which is a beautiful city, famous for its ice and snow world. Every year thousands of visitors, including westerners, will come here just for a glance of it.

My favorite hobby is reading books, which can enlarge my knowledge, broaden my horizon and enrich my life.
Besides, I'm optimistic, and I'd like to get along well with every person I met.

Please give an opportunity to me, I won't let you down.

Thank you for your attention.
